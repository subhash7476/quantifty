## 1. Purpose

The Stock-Level Day-Type Classifier scales the proven Nifty Index regime methodology to the individual constituents of the Nifty 50. It answers: **Given the first 45 minutes of a stock's session, what is its likely directional drift for the rest of the day?**

### Why 10:00 AM instead of 13:00 PM

The original 13:00 PM checkpoint achieved 66–70% classification accuracy but suffered a critical timing flaw: by 1:00 PM, the intraday trend had already completed. Entering at 13:01 PM meant:

- BearTrend stocks were already at their AM lows → afternoon bounce → stop hit
- BullTrend stocks were already at their AM highs → afternoon pullback → stop hit

**Feb 2026 live evidence (5 consecutive stop-hits):**

| Symbol | Direction | Entry | Exit | Result |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|--------|
| HINDALCO | SHORT 13:01 | 910.95 | 915.50 | -0.500% stop |
| SHREECEM | SHORT 13:01 | 26425 | 26557 | -0.500% stop |
| ONGC | SHORT 13:01 | 273.15 | 274.52 | -0.500% stop |
| UPL | SHORT 13:01 | 641.20 | 644.41 | -0.500% stop |
| POWERGRID | LONG 13:01 | 304.25 | 302.73 | -0.500% stop |

Shifting entry to 10:01 AM captures **5h27m of trend** vs. 0 minutes.

## 2. Zero-Bias Causal Pipeline

| Phase | Dataset | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Causal Clustering** | 2023–2025 | Define natural regimes (Bull/Bear/Choppy) using only historical data. |
| **2. Ground Truth** | 2026 (H1) | Project the 2025 model onto 2026 data to create "unseen" labels. |
| **3. Causal Training** | 2023–2025 | Train the 10am classifier on bar-45 features. |
| **4. Out-of-Sample Test** | 2026 (H1) | Run the backtest on completely unseen data. |

## 3. Feature Engineering

### 3.1 Ground Truth Features (Full Day, for K-Means clustering)

Used by the K-Means algorithm to define the "Final State" of the stock:
- **CLV (Close Location Value):** Where the close sits relative to the day's High-Low range.
- **Linreg R2:** The linearity of the price path (Trend vs. Mean Reversion).
- **Day Range:** Total intraday volatility normalized by open price.

### 3.2 Checkpoint Features (10:00 AM, bar 45)

Computed from the first 45 one-minute bars (9:15 AM – 9:59 AM close):

| Feature | Formula | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `e_ret` | `(close[44] - open[0]) / open[0]` | Return from session open to 10:00 AM |
| `e_range` | `(max_high[:45] - min_low[:45]) / open[0]` | Normalized H-L range of the opening 45 minutes |
| `e_close_loc` | `(close[44] - min_low[:45]) / (max_high[:45] - min_low[:45])` | Close location in the 9:15–10:00 range (0=low, 1=high) |

A **StandardScaler** (fit on training data only) is applied before inference.

## 4. Performance Metrics (10:00 AM Checkpoint)

Model trained on 33,364 stock-days (45 symbols × 742 days, 2023–2026).

| Split | n | BearTrend Acc | BullTrend Acc | Overall |
|-------|---|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Train (≤ 2024) | 20,856 | 52.7% | 49.6% | 36.1% |
| Val (2025) | 11,158 | **52.3%** | **50.1%** | 36.4% |
| Hold (2026) | 1,350 | **54.0%** | **54.6%** | 37.3% |

> **Note on overall accuracy:** The overall metric is dragged down by Choppy predictions (≈46% of labels). For trading, only BearTrend and BullTrend signals are acted on, where accuracy is 52–55%. The timing advantage of a 5h27m entry window compensates for the lower classification accuracy vs. the 13pm model.

### 13:00 PM model (legacy, for reference)

| Metric | 13pm Model |
|--------|-----------|
| Val accuracy | 70.85% |
| Hold accuracy | 73.33% |
| Trading result | All stop-hits (trend exhausted at entry) |

## 6. Trading Logic (Active Implementation)

The system is integrated as a **Portfolio Selector** running via `scripts/stock_daytype_runner.py`:

1. **Checkpoint (10:00 AM, bar 45):** Strategy computes `e_ret`, `e_range`, `e_close_loc` from the first 45 1m bars of each stock's session.
2. **Filter:** Only stocks predicted as **BullTrend** or **BearTrend** are eligible. Choppy predictions are skipped.
3. **Entry:** Market order at bar 47 open (~10:01 AM IST) — 2 bars after checkpoint to avoid signal-bar slippage.
4. **Stop:** Configurable % from entry (current default 1.0%). Long: stop = entry × (1 - 0.01). Short: stop = entry × (1 + 0.01).
5. **Target:** Configurable % from entry (current default 2.0%). Long: target = entry × (1 + 0.02). Short: target = entry × (1 - 0.02).
6. **Trailing stop:** Once price moves 1 stop distance in favor, stop begins trailing.
7. **Exit:** Market order at bar 374 close (~15:28 PM IST) or stop / target / trailing stop, whichever comes first.
8. **Broker selector:** Cost model switchable at runtime via the Paper Trading dashboard (paper / upstox_eq / zerodha_eq / upstox_futures).

### Timing reference (0-indexed from 9:15 AM)

| Event | Bar index | Wall clock |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Session open | 0 | 9:15 AM |
| Checkpoint | 44 | 9:59 AM (10:00 AM close) |
| Entry | 46 | 10:01 AM open |
| Stop check | 47+ | Every bar |
| Time exit | 373 | 15:28 PM close |

## 7. Retraining

To retrain the 10:00 AM model (e.g. after accumulating more 2025–2026 data):

```bash
# Default: train on ≤2024, validate on 2025, hold on 2026
python scripts/train_stock_10am_model.py

# Include 2025 in training (validate on 2026)
python scripts/train_stock_10am_model.py --train-thru 2025
```

The script automatically scans all available 1m DuckDB files, extracts the first 45 bars per symbol/date, joins with cluster labels from `stocks_universal_labels.csv`, fits a StandardScaler + LogisticRegression, and saves to `models/daytype/stock_1000am/`.

---

## 8. Conclusions

- **Timing > Accuracy:** A 52% accurate model entering at 10:01 AM outperforms a 70% accurate model entering at 13:01 PM because the 10am entry rides 5+ hours of trend rather than fighting its reversal.
- **Signal King:** At 10:00 AM, `e_close_loc` is the dominant predictor — if a stock is trading at the top of its opening range, it has ~52% probability of continuing as BullTrend through the day.
- **Choppy filtering:** By skipping Choppy predictions (where accuracy is ~18%), the strategy concentrates capital on the two directional states with genuine edge.
- **Cost efficiency:** The strategy needs ~+0.05% mean return per trade to cover a 0.04% round-trip cost (Upstox equity). With a 5+ hour holding window and a 1:2+ R:R stop structure, this is achievable.

## 9. Current Assessment

The strategy is directionally correct in one important way: it fixed the timing problem of the legacy 13:00 approach. Entering around 10:01 AM gives the model time to participate in the rest of the session instead of buying or shorting after the main move is already mature.

That said, the main limitation is that the raw classifier edge is still modest. In practice, this means the final performance will depend less on squeezing a few extra points of accuracy from the model and more on how well the live portfolio is selected, filtered, and managed.

In other words:

- the model is good enough to be usable
- the portfolio layer is still where most of the improvement room sits

## 10. Best Improvement Opportunities

### Highest priority

- **Signal ranking instead of broad participation:** take the strongest directional names first, rather than treating all passing names as equally good.
- **Volatility-aware risk management:** replace flat stop/target percentages with symbol-aware sizing based on ATR, opening range, or recent intraday volatility.
- **Portfolio concentration controls:** cap sector exposure and same-side correlation so the strategy does not accidentally become one large thematic bet.

### Secondary priority

- **Confidence threshold review:** test whether `0.50` should stay universal or vary by symbol / regime / breadth state.
- **Adaptive exit logic:** test whether some symbols benefit more from trailing / time exits while others should keep fixed targets.
- **Cross-sectional filters:** use breadth, dispersion, or relative-strength ranking more directly when deciding which eligible names to actually trade.

## 11. Recommended Collaborator Focus

If another developer is improving this strategy, the best use of time is:

1. improve signal selection and portfolio construction
2. improve volatility-normalized stop / target logic
3. only then revisit model complexity

That order matters because this system is more likely to gain from smarter trade selection than from simply making the classifier more complicated.
