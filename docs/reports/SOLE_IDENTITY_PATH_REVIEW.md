# SOLE_IDENTITY_PATH_REVIEW.md

**Type:** Gate G1 review + migration plan — **survey + plan only; NO order-path code in this document or this turn.**
**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Phase:** Review Gate G1 (`PHASE_4C_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §2) — the last identity-scope readiness track before 4C.7.
**Question G1 answers:** *Can any live F&O execution path construct an instrument identity WITHOUT going through `InstrumentResolver` / `CanonicalInstrument`?*
**Verdict today: YES — legacy construction remains (G1 OPEN).** This document is the plan that drives it to **"No"**; it is updated to conclude "No" only when Section 6's closure criteria are met and proven.
**Scope (locked, mirrors the MM.4 gate):** "sole identity source" is asserted on the **live F&O path** — the only path where the MM.4 startup gate guarantees the master is present. Equity-only-LIVE and paper/replay are explicit **carve-outs**, not forced-canonical.
**Basis (file:line, verified 2026-06-09):** `handler.py`, `order_factory.py`, `position_models.py`, `position_tracker.py`, `order_models.py`, `persistence/{order,position}_repository.py`, `options/selector.py`, `greeks/greeks_calculator.py`. Supersedes the pre-MM.5 enumeration in `PHASE_4C_WIRING_REVIEW.md` §3.

> **G1 / 4C.7 boundary (load-bearing — do not cross):** G1 makes `CanonicalInstrument` the identity **source** — construct canonical, then *derive* the legacy `Option`/`Future`/`Equity` from it. **The broker payload is byte-for-byte unchanged** (same symbol, same fields). The moment the payload *uses* the canonical `instrument_key` / `ci.product`, that is **4C.7** (a behavior change) and stays blocked. Keeping G1 behavior-preserving is also what keeps the Section 4 characterization tests green across the migration.

## Section 1 — Current State (the 11 legacy identity sites)

| # | Site | Lines | Object created | Runtime frequency | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `handler.process_signal` non-option branch | `handler.py:513` | legacy `Option`/`Future`/`Equity` via `InstrumentParser.parse(signal.symbol)` | per non-option signal (every futures/equity order) | **HIGH** — primary order-build identity |
| 2 | `handler` batch/group order build | `handler.py:621` | legacy instrument via `parse` | per signal in a batch/group order | **HIGH** — order-build identity (batch) |
| 3 | `handler._check_greek_limits` | `handler.py:720` | legacy instrument via `parse`, fed to `GreeksCalculator.calculate` | per option signal (pre-trade risk gate) | **MED** — transient; identity never leaves the site; greeks are now `asset_class`-dispatched (4C.6) |
| 4 | `handler` option branch → selector | `handler.py:505` → `selector.py:115` | legacy `Option`; **`lot_size` already resolver-sourced** (`selector.py:108-113`, F4: NIFTY→65) | per option signal | **HIGH** — the live option-sizing site (F4 active-on-materialization) |
| 5 | `OrderFactory.create_order` | `order_factory.py:34` | legacy instrument via `parse` | per order **iff** invoked — **handler builds `NormalizedOrder` directly, not via `OrderFactory`** (caller audit needed: likely non-runtime/parallel) | **LOW–MED** — verify live reachability (prove-dead candidate) |
| 6 | `Position(symbol=…)` ctor | `position_models.py:47` | legacy instrument via `parse(symbol or "")` | every `Position` built by symbol (tracker default + restore) | **HIGH** — position identity |
| 7 | `PositionTracker.get_position` | `position_tracker.py:31` | legacy instrument → FLAT `Position` | **VERY HIGH** — every lookup of an untracked symbol (per signal) | **HIGH** — position-key identity |
| 8 | Order restore (replay) | `order_repository.py:60` | legacy `NormalizedOrder.instrument` via `parse(row[1])` | once per persisted order, **at handler construction** (`load_db_state=True` → `_replay_state`, `handler.py:186-187`) | **HIGH** — the restart-flip; **center of gravity** |
| 9 | Position restore (replay) | `position_repository.py:51` | legacy `Position.instrument` via `parse(row[0])` | once per persisted position, **at handler construction** | **HIGH** — the restart-flip; **center of gravity** |
| 10 | `NormalizedOrder(symbol=…)` ctor | `order_models.py:62-70` | **direct `Equity(symbol)` — ALWAYS Equity, even for options/futures** (latent defect) | per `NormalizedOrder` built by symbol — **handler builds via `instrument=`, so this branch is likely dormant** | **LOW–MED** — prove-dead candidate; flag the always-Equity defect |
| 11 | `GreeksCalculator.calculate` dispatch | `greeks_calculator.py:23-34` | none — dispatches on `_asset_class(instrument)` (4C.6) | per greek calc | **DONE** — already `asset_class`-dispatched; works for canonical **and** legacy |

**Construction-vs-gate timing (verified):** restore (#8/#9) runs inside `_replay_state()` at **handler construction** (`handler.py:186-187`), which is **before** the driver's MM.4 master-readiness gate (`driver.run()` → `_run_startup_gate`, reusing the constructed handler's state). A canonical restore would therefore resolve against a **not-yet-gate-verified** master — the constraint Section 3 resolves.

## Section 2 — Migration Classification

Legend: **MIGRATE** = construct `CanonicalInstrument` (resolver-sourced) and derive the legacy object from it · **DERIVE** = already resolver-sourced in part; complete the canonical-derivation · **CARVE-OUT** = out of the live-F&O sole-source scope, stays legacy by design (documented, not a gap).

| # | Site | Class | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | handler:513 order-build | **MIGRATE** (futures) / **CARVE-OUT** (equity) | Futures: `resolve_future` → canonical → derive legacy `Future`. Equity: canonical `EQUITY` requires `isin` (`canonical.py:_validate`) which a bare symbol cannot supply, and equity is out of the F&O scope — stays legacy. |
| 2 | handler:621 batch build | **MIGRATE** (futures) / **CARVE-OUT** (equity) | Mirror of #1 on the batch path. |
| 3 | handler:720 greek-limit | **CARVE-OUT** | Identity is transient and never leaves the site; `GreeksCalculator` is `asset_class`-dispatched (4C.6) and correct on legacy types. No canonical needed. |
| 4 | selector (option) | **DERIVE** | `lot_size` is already resolver-sourced; complete it — have `select()` resolve a `CanonicalInstrument` and derive the legacy `Option` from it (same symbol/lot). Tie-in: **F4 (65) must be exchange-verified before this path goes live.** |
| 5 | OrderFactory.create_order | **CARVE-OUT (prove-dead)** → else MIGRATE | Handler builds `NormalizedOrder` directly; audit for a live caller. If none, mark dead (remove in a later cleanup); if live, MIGRATE like #1. |
| 6 | Position(symbol=) | **MIGRATE** | Position identity on the live path; build from a resolved canonical (derive legacy instrument). |
| 7 | tracker.get_position | **MIGRATE** | Highest-frequency identity construction; the position key must be canonical-sourced on the live F&O path. |
| 8 | order restore | **MIGRATE (via Section 3 Option B)** | Restart-flip. Migrated **not** at the restore site (stays legacy at construction) but via the post-gate canonical upgrade — see Section 3. |
| 9 | position restore | **MIGRATE (via Section 3 Option B)** | Same as #8. |
| 10 | NormalizedOrder(symbol=) | **CARVE-OUT (prove-dead)** | Handler builds via `instrument=`; this symbol= branch is likely dormant. Prove dead; **separately flag the always-`Equity` defect** (it would mistype an option/future) — fix or remove in cleanup, tracked, not silently folded. |
| 11 | greeks dispatch | **CARVE-OUT (done)** | 4C.6 — already `asset_class`-dispatched. |

**Net:** the live-F&O sole-source migration is **#1/#2 (futures), #4, #6, #7, #8/#9**. Carve-outs (#3, #5?, #10, #11, equity) are documented, not gaps. #5/#10 require a prove-dead caller audit first (Wave 1).

## Section 3 — Restore Strategy (LOCKED: Option B)

**Chosen: Option B — restore legacy at construction, then upgrade-to-canonical after the MM.4 gate passes.**

- **What:** `_replay_state()` keeps building **legacy** instruments at handler construction (#8/#9 unchanged at the restore site — deterministic, master-independent). After the driver's `_run_startup_gate` confirms master readiness (FRESH/WARN), a **single post-gate canonicalization pass** re-resolves the restored ledger's identities through `InstrumentResolver`, replacing legacy identity with canonical-derived identity on the live F&O entries.
- **Rationale:**
  1. **No env/restart type-flip (ADR-003).** Restore output never depends on master presence — it is always legacy at construction, so a missing/absent master can't make restore produce a different type. Canonical only ever appears *after* the gate has proven the master is present.
  2. **Resolves the sequencing collision** without re-opening MM.4. Option (a) (move the master-check before recovery) would reverse MM.4's deliberate `recovery → master-check → reconciliation` ordering (Decision 2); Option (c) (restore re-resolves) resolves against an unverified master. Option B touches neither.
  3. **Reconciliation stays canonical-correct:** the upgrade runs *before* reconciliation, so positions are matched through canonical identity (the MM.4 intent).
- **Locked — do not reopen.** Alternatives (a) move-check-before-recovery and (c) restore-re-resolves are **rejected** for the reasons above. Any future proposal to change this must cite new evidence, not re-litigate.

## Section 4 — Characterization Tests (safety net — BEFORE any migration)

The live order-build/restore path is **untested** (`PHASE_4C_WIRING_REVIEW.md`: "zero regression in the untested live path"). Before touching the riskiest surface in the repo, pin current behavior so every migration step is **provably behavior-preserving** (TDD applied to a refactor: identical assertions green before and after each wave). Required golden-path coverage:

1. **Build order** — option + futures signal → `process_signal` → assert the resulting `NormalizedOrder` (symbol, lot/quantity, side, type) byte-for-byte. (Option case pins the F4 lot value as the current behavior, whatever the exchange-verification later decides.)
2. **Persist** — order + position written to the SQLite ledger → assert the persisted rows (symbol string, fields).
3. **Restore** — construct a handler with `load_db_state=True` over that ledger → assert the restored orders/positions match what was persisted (the round-trip).
4. **Reconcile** — restored ledger vs a broker-position fixture → assert the reconciliation verdict (empty/PASS or the expected diff).

These four become the regression net; **no migration wave merges unless all four stay green.** They must assert the **broker-facing payload** explicitly (the G1/4C.7 boundary tripwire — if a payload byte changes, the migration crossed into 4C.7).

---

## Section 5 — Migration Waves (each with an explicit rollback point)

Each wave is an independent commit; the characterization suite (Section 4) must be green before and after. **Rollback = revert the wave's commit** (no forward-fix required); waves are ordered least→most risk so an early rollback never strands a later one.

| Wave | Scope | Sites | Rollback point |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — non-runtime / prove-dead** | Caller audit of `OrderFactory` (#5) and `NormalizedOrder(symbol=)` (#10); mark dead + carve-out (or pull into Wave 2 if live); document #3 carve-out. **No live-path behavior change.** | #5, #10, #3 | revert; nothing live touched |
| **2 — order construction** | `handler` order-build (#1 futures, #4 option-via-selector) construct `CanonicalInstrument` and derive the legacy object; same broker payload. | #1, #2, #4 | revert → back to `parse`-built legacy; characterization green proves parity |
| **3 — position construction** | `Position(symbol=)` (#6) + `tracker.get_position` (#7) build identity from a resolved canonical. | #6, #7 | revert → legacy position identity |
| **4 — restore path (Option B)** | Keep `_replay_state` legacy; add the **post-gate canonicalization pass** (Section 3) in the driver startup sequence, before reconciliation. The highest-risk wave. | #8, #9 (+ driver upgrade hook) | revert the upgrade pass → restore stays legacy (today's behavior); gate/reconcile unchanged |
| **5 — canonical-only validation** | The closure proof: an AST/grep guard test (ADR-002-style) asserting **no `InstrumentParser.parse` is reachable from the live F&O order-build/restore path**, and that every live-F&O order/position identity is canonical-derived. Flip this document's verdict to **"No."** | guard test | n/a (validation only) |

**F4 dependency:** Wave 2 (#4 option path) must not go *live* until F4 (lot 65/30) is exchange-verified — the verification is a precondition for the live option path, tracked separately.

---

## Section 6 — Gate Closure Definition (the crisp exit criterion)

**G1 closes — and this document flips to "No — `CanonicalInstrument` is the sole identity source" — iff all of the following are simultaneously true and proven:**

1. **No live F&O order path creates identity from `InstrumentParser.parse()`.** (Sites #1/#2 futures, #4 — migrated; #3 carve-out justified; restore #8/#9 legacy-at-construction but canonicalized post-gate before any live F&O use.)
2. **No live F&O order path constructs `Option`/`Future` directly from a symbol string** (bypassing the resolver). Every live-F&O order/position identity is either resolver-sourced or *derived* from a resolver-sourced `CanonicalInstrument`.
3. **`CanonicalInstrument` is the sole identity source on the live F&O path** — including across a restart (the Option B post-gate upgrade closes the persistence round-trip; no restart leaves a live F&O entry legacy-typed once the gate has passed).
4. **Carve-outs are documented, not silent:** equity (ISIN-less symbol; out of F&O scope) and paper/replay remain legacy by explicit decision, named here.
5. **Mechanically verifiable:** a committed guard test (Wave 5, ADR-002-style AST/import scan) fails if any `InstrumentParser.parse` / direct `Option`/`Future` construction becomes reachable from the live F&O order-build or post-gate-restore path. This is the measurable "green," not a subjective "looks migrated."

**Until #1–#5 hold with the Section 4 suite green, G1 remains OPEN and this document's verdict stays "Yes — legacy construction remains."**

## Implementation Status (live)

| Migration target | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Wave 1** — prove-dead audit (#5 `OrderFactory`, #10 `NormalizedOrder(symbol=)`), #3 carve-out | **COMPLETE** | `G1_WAVE1_REPORT.md` |
| **Wave 2A** — broker-payload truth + characterization net (7/7 green) | **COMPLETE** | `G1_WAVE2A_BROKER_PAYLOAD_REVIEW.md` |
| **#1** — `handler.process_signal` non-option branch → Future Resolution | **COMPLETE** | see below |
| **#2** — restore path | **IN PROGRESS** | Wave 3A (restore reality pinned) + Wave 3B (gate-ordering review, orders-vs-positions = SEPARATE) + Option-B slot wired (`driver._canonicalize_restored_ledger`) + **restored POSITION canonicalization (#7-as-restored) COMPLETE** (`canonical_restore.canonicalize_symbol` + `PositionTracker.replace_instrument` + `ExecutionHandler.canonicalize_restored_positions`; futures EQUITY→FUTURE, option lot→master); **restored ORDER (#8) in-place swap NOT STARTED** |
| **#4** — option path (selector → canonical-derived `Option`) | PLANNED (F4-gated) | not started |
| #6/#7 — position construction | PLANNED | not started |

**Target #1 — COMPLETE (2026-06-09).** Resolved **F-PARSE-1**. Implemented via:
- `core/execution/futures.py` — `resolve_future(symbol, timestamp, resolver=None)` (regex-detect → `InstrumentResolver.resolve_future` → `CanonicalInstrument` → derive legacy `Future`; canonical internal-only).
- `ExecutionHandler` integration — `handler.py:513` non-option `else` branch calls `resolve_future` first, falls through to the unchanged `InstrumentParser.parse` for non-futures.

Characterization coverage:
- `test_build_order_futures_currently_falls_back_to_equity` (characterization, assertion updated `EQUITY → FUTURE`; symbol/side/qty/type assertions preserved)
- `test_non_future_symbols_return_none`
- `test_master_present_resolves_canonical_lot_and_expiry`
- `test_master_absent_still_derives_future`

Broker payload / persistence / restore / reconciliation contracts **unchanged** (`G1_WAVE2_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` §7–10). Full suite **379 passing, 0 failing**.

## NEXT ACTIVE TARGET

**#2 — Restore Path.** (G1 stays OPEN until the Section-6 closure proof holds.)

---

## Status & next step

**Verdict today: G1 OPEN ("Yes").** Wave 1 (prove-dead audit) and Wave 2 Migration Target #1 (Future Resolution) are **complete** (see Implementation Status above); the remaining sites still need migrating. Execution continues per the wave plan, characterization tests (Section 4) green before and after each wave, each wave independently revertible. 4C.7 stays blocked throughout (G1 is behavior-preserving; 4C.7 is the broker-payload change that follows G1 closure). **G1 is not closed.**
